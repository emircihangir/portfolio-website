                Flutter, by default, uses Material widgets, and Material Design has a different logic and style compared to Apple's Cupertino design.
                For comparison, here's what a boilerplate Flutter Mac app looks like:
                <br>
                <img src="assets/pic-1.png">
                <br>
                You can change the widgets, of course, but the app still looks quite different from what Mac users are used to:
                <br>
                <!-- TODO: slider is not obvious -->
                <div style="display: flex; overflow: scroll; align-items: center;">
                    <img src="assets/pic-2.png">
                    <img src="assets/pic-3.png">
                    <img src="assets/pic-4.png">
                </div>
                <br>
                So what can we do to change this? Well, there are a few options:
                <br><br>

                <!-- TODO: add link to macos_ui -->

                <h3>Using a package</h3>
                You can use a package like macos_ui, but it comes with several disadvantages.
                First of all, relying on such a package means your app's UI is tied to third-party code.
                This limits your control over both the package and your app's UI design.
                <br>
                Furthermore, macOS UI is constantly evolving. Just a week ago, Apple released macOS Tahoe, which introduced a new aesthetic compared to the previous version.
                If you had built your app with this package, you might now find the UI outdated and no longer aligned with Apple's design language.

                <br><br>

                <h3>Manually styling the entire app</h3>
                You could manually style every part of the app to better match the macOS design language, but this would be very time-consuming and impractical.
                The problem of fluidity of design languages still persists with this option, because if Apple were to release another UI update (which they will, eventually),
                you'd have to restyle every component all over again.
                <br><br>
                So then, what should we do? Here's my solution:
                <br><br>
                <h3>Something in between</h3>
                Don't use a third-party package, but don't spend too much time copying MacOS UI either. There are a few simple things you can do
                that makes the app less strange. Not totally native, but less strange. Let's start by changing the app bar and some colors.
                <br><br>
                As you may have noticed, there is a slight purple tint as the background color in our Flutter app. Let's change that.
                Update your main.dart file per following:
                <br><br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/emircihangir/b68595aee01b76965324df39ca44f803.js"></script>
                <br><br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/emircihangir/e872815f36d02516370b504ba6fe3b99.js"></script>
                <br><br>
                Now, our app looks like this:
                <br>
                <img src="assets/pic-5.png" alt="">
                <br>
                Hang in there, we have a few more things to do.
                <br>
                The next step is to tap into Xcode for some native adjustments. Open the macos folder in Xcode and make these changes:
                <br><br>
                <img src="assets/tutorial-video-720p.gif">
                <br><br>
                Now, our app looks like this:
                <br>
                <img src="assets/pic-6.png">
                <br>
                We're getting closer. Lastly, we will move the floating aciton button to the title bar. Make these changes to your code:
                <br><br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/emircihangir/d5bfd1ee0e8c6ddd1e23a0c2f2d7987b.js"></script>
                <br><br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/emircihangir/bef5b5f58ada4444e8051141b5fca395.js"></script>
                <br><br>
                Now, our app looks like this:
                <img src="assets/pic-7.png">
                <br>
                Here is a before and after comparison:
                <div style="display: flex; overflow: scroll; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="assets/pic-1.png">
                    <img src="assets/pic-7.png">
                </div>
                <br>
                We've accomplished to make our app look much more native with a few simple tricks.
                <br><br>
                Happy coding!
