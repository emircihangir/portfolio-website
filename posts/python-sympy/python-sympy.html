                <br> <br>

                SymPy is a Python library that allows you to do 
                symbolic calculations. Its ease of use and lightweight 
                structure have made it a popular choice among the scientific community. 
                You can do all sorts of amazing things, and it really is a lifesaver 
                when you find yourself buried under tons of equations and formulas. 
                Here are a few ways you can use SymPy:

                <h3>Before We Get Started</h3>
                Please keep in mind that this tutorial assumes you have basic Python skills. Additionally, the following codes are meant to be executed inside a Jupyter Notebook.
                <br>
                Install the sympy library by running the following command in your terminal:
                <br>
                <div class="code">
                    > pip install sympy
                </div>
                That's it, you're all set!

                <br><br>
                
                <h3>Solving Equations</h3>
                Let's start with the basics, and find the roots of an equation. 
                <br>
                <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 263px;" src="assets/iframe-1.html" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                <br>
                The two parameters passed to the sympy.Eq are reffered to as the lhs (left-hand-side) and rhs (right-hand-side) respectively. You can access these properties like so:
                <br>
                <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 161px;" src="assets/iframe-2.html" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                <br>
                The above example deals with a fairly straightforward equation, but SymPy becomes particularly useful when handling equations that would be too time-consuming 
                to solve manually, such as this one below:
                <br>
                <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 178px;" src="assets/iframe-3.html" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                <br>

                <br><br>
                <h3>Expanding and Factorizing Expressions</h3>
                You may come across situations where you need to expand or factorize a given expression. 
                Luckily, SymPy is equipped with this:
                <br>
                <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 413px;" src="assets/iframe-4.html" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                <br>
                This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can do much more with SymPy. Follow this <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">link</a> to visit the
